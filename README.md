# tic-tac-toe

 This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React JS. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

 ## Technical details
This project was built using React JS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The game board is rendered using React components, and the state of the game is managed using React's built-in state management system.

The project also uses CSS for styling and includes some basic animations to make the game more visually appealing.
